Completed:

Access playlist
1. Get playlist id from user (User enters a url, we use re (probably?) to access the playlist id)
2. Use the Spotify.playlist or .playlist_tracks method to access the relevant playlist

Use the playlist id to access the song ids for the tracks in the playlist

Use sp.audio_analysis() to get audio analysis for a given track


TODO:
Create function to order playlist by a given feature

Figure out most efficient way to organise (e.g., should I just iterate over it, or should I sort it first) [Probably iterate, as we might want to sort the same playlist by different criteria]
